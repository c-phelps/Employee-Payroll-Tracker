# Employee-Payroll-Tracker
by Chris Phelps

## Purpose of this repo
The goal of this repo is to have a working payroll tracker that will allow the user to add emplyee's first name, last name and salary.\
When one employee is added the tracker will prompt the user to continue adding new employees or to cancel\
When the user selects continue, they are able to add information for another employee.\
When the user selects cancel, they are given an overview of all employee data sorted alphabetically by last name.\
When the user inspects the window and opens the console, they will be given an average of all employees' salaries.\
The user will also be given a random employee as the weekly drawing winner.
